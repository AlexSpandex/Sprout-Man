## Sprout ManðŸŒ±
This is a platformer game where you go through the levels designed around certain programming concepts such as if statments, loops and recursion. Each level has a gimmick related to a certain programming concept. 

## Runthrough
Our recursion level will keep repeating itself until a certain base case is met. The if statement level will impact the users progress through the game based on the path they decied to take. The for loop level will require players to iterate through a passage a set number of times, much like how a for loop repeats a set number of times. Through the gimmicks designed in each level we hope to provide players with a basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
